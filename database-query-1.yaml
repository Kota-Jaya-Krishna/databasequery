  #To connect to a database and execute a query without directly including user credentials in the YAML file, 
  #you can use Ansible Vault or a pre-configured .my.cnf file on the target servers. Here's how you can achieve it:
  #steps:
  #Deploy .my.cnf on target servers as described earlier. 
  #This file contains database credentials securely stored with restricted permissions (chmod 600).
